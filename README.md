# zk-regex

A library to do regex verification in circom, adapted from the original zk-email. Also spits out a halo2 lookup table for [halo2-regex](https://github.com/zkemail/halo2-regex) parsing. Note that you need to add valid accept states and substring definitions yourself. Releasing a tool to do this soon.

We've forked [min-dfa into a UI here](https://mindfa.onrender.com/min_dfa) to create a UI that converts existing regexes with [] support, as well as escapes \_, and the character classes a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. It also shows the DFA states very clearly so you can choose accept states easily. This should make converting regexes into DFA form way cleaner.

## introduction

The compilation command generates a circom file at build/compiled.circom. This code is a JS adaptation of the Python regex-to-circom work done by [sampriti](https://github.com/sampritipanda/) and [yush_g](https://twitter.com/yush_g) at https://github.com/zk-email-verify/zk-email-verify/tree/main/regex_to_circom.

In addition to the original work, this library also supports the following features:

- CLI to dynamically generate regex circuit based on regex argument
- Extended regex circuit template to support:
  - differentiate the match counts between the entire regex and the matched groups of alternate character sets
  - allow specifying which alternate group for data points
  - allow specifying which group match to reveal

### theory

To understand the theory behind the regex circuit compiler, please checkout [this blog post](https://katat.me/blog/ZK+Regex) (edits in progress). You can also look at the original regex description and how it ties into the original zk email work at the [original zk-email blog post regex overview](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/zkemail#regex-deterministic-finite-automata-in-zk).

## how to use

### install

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

### CLI

There is a CLI to generate the regex circuit based on the regex argument. The CLI will generate the circuit file in the folder `./build`. For example, the following command

```
yarn compile "abc (a|b|c)+" circuit_name
```

will generate the circuit file at `build/circuit_name.circom`

### circuit usage

The generated circuit has

- 3 template arguments:
  - msg_bytes: the number of characters for the input message to match against
  - reveal_bytes: the number of characters to reveal from the matched group
  - group_idx: the index of the group to reveal
- 2 input signals:
  - msg[msg_bytes]: the input message to match against
  - match_idx: the index of the group to reveal
- 4 output signals:
  - entire_count: the number of matches in the entire regex
  - group_match_count: the number of matches for the alternate group
  - start_idx: the start position index of the matched for the alternate group
  - reveal_shifted: revealed values from the matched group

Take the regex `1=(a|b) (2=(b|c)+ )+d` for example. The match against the input message `1=a 2=c 2=bc 2=cb d` will have the following template argument values:

- msg_bytes: 20 (the length of the input message, and it can be greater than the actual length of the message)
- reveal_bytes: 2 (the expected maximum length of the revealed string)
- group_idx: 1 (targets 2nd alternate group, as it is zero-indexed)

and input signals:

- msg: `1=a 2=c 2=bc 2=cb d`
- match_idx: 1 (targets 2nd matched for the alternate group, as it is zero-indexed)

then it should generate output signals:

- entire_count: 1
- group_match_count: 3
- start_idx: 10
- reveal_shifted: `bc`

For more examples in action, please checkout the test cases in the `test` folder.

## development

Welcome any questions, suggestions or PRs!

### testing

For ease of testing and debugging, for now this repo uses a custom version of `circom_tester`, a pending PR to the original repo is here: https://github.com/iden3/circom_tester/pull/15

Run this the following command to run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## future work

### better align with regex grammar

- [ ] support character class regex grammar (so as to simplify the regular expressions)
- [ ] better compatibility with regex grammar (will need a set of different tests to assert the compatibility between circuit and regex in languages)
